# Hooroo API Tools (ACTUAL NAME TBD)

Provides fast serialization/deserialization of models with simple model attribute definition in client apps.

###Why?
We tried using active model serializer and virtus for serialization and model attribute definition/coercion
and found that they both performed quite badly. At this stage, this gem provides the stuff we need for a fraction
of the performance footprint.  Performance is critial for this gem so any changes must be made with this in mind.

Proper Docs to come.


## Installation
